# Question 4 — Doubly Linked List Insert and Delete

## Data Structures Used
Each node stores data and two pointers: previous and next.

## Functions Implemented
- `append()` — Adds node at end.
- `insert_after()` — Inserts node after given position.
- `delete_node()` — Removes node safely.
- `print_forward()` — Displays list.

## main() Overview
Demonstrates insertion and deletion operations.

## Sample Output
Initial: 10 20 30 40  
After inserting 25 after 20: 10 20 25 30 40  
After deleting 30: 10 20 25 40
