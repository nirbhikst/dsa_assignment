# Question 5 — Graph Traversal (BFS and DFS)

## Data Structures Used
An adjacency matrix represents an undirected graph. Arrays track visited nodes.

## Functions Implemented
- `bfs()` — Traverses graph using queue.
- `dfs()` — Recursive depth-first traversal.

## main() Overview
Creates a sample graph and demonstrates traversal.

## Sample Output
BFS: 0 1 2 3 4 5  
DFS: 0 1 3 5 4 2
