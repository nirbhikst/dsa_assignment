# Question 7 — Shortest Path Using Dijkstra’s Algorithm

## Data Structures Used
Adjacency matrix represents weighted graph. Arrays store distances and visited flags.

## Functions Implemented
- `dijkstra()` — Computes shortest paths.
- Helper selects minimum distance vertex.

## main() Overview
Builds a weighted graph and calculates shortest paths from a source node.

## Sample Output
Shortest distances from 0:  
0 -> 1 : 3  
0 -> 2 : 1  
0 -> 3 : 4  
0 -> 4 : 7
